# Electric_vehicle_charging_station_navigation_service

This project is a service that receives data from electric vehicle charging stations across the country in real time from a public data portal(https://www.data.go.kr/) and provides the locations and routes of three charging stations in consideration of whether it is the closest to the vehicle's current location and whether the charger can be used immediately.
